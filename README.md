# Ohas ssh Manager

This is my shitty try at making a decent ssh connection manager. Currently somewhat functional.
## Installation
Just execute this file with python idk

## Usage
The script will give you 2 options whens started.  
Press **1** to add a new connection and provide your servers details.  
Press **2** and select a listed option to connect to a saved connection.  

## Current issues / Planed features
- [ ] Program only works with Konsole
- [ ] Program crashes if folder exists but file doesnt
- [ ] Remove existing saves
- [ ] You tell me
